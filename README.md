**Virus Treatment Centers [VirusTC]** presents this clinical summary of its advanced UV-C hematology protocols, currently integrated into patient care at the **Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center**, the **University of Washington Medicine**, and affiliated **University Medical Centers**. These initiatives align with the federal **Cancer Moonshot Initiative** and established standing orders to revolutionize blood safety and patient outcomes.

### **The Clinical Significance of UV-C Hematology**

For the medical professional community, VirusTC's UV-C protocols represent a transition from passive filtration to **active pathogen destruction**. While standard hemodialysis and apheresis rely on mechanical removal, VirusTC integrates **Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT)** to neutralize life-threatening complications like sepsis and septicemia in a matter of hours rather than weeks.

-   **Dual-Action Mechanism**: The treatment utilizes UV-C light (specifically at 254 nm) to induce **photochemical genetic inactivation** via pyrimidine dimers, permanently breaking the DNA/RNA of viruses and bacteria to prevent replication. Simultaneously, it generates medical-grade **ozone ($O_3$)**, which physically oxidizes and destroys viral envelopes and bacterial cell walls.

-   **AEIOU Crisis Intervention**: This method is specifically optimized for urgent dialysis needs (Acidosis, Electrolyte imbalance, Intoxication, Overload, and Uremia), where the speed of photochemical destruction "buys time" for critically ill patients.

-   **Autologous Safety**: By treating a patient's own blood, the protocol eliminates the risk of transfusion-related complications such as immune reactions or the transmission of unknown pathogens from donor supplies.

### **Integration and Technical Excellence**

The "unified" approach involves sophisticated "defense-in-depth" filtration models:

-   **Scalable Filtration**: Clinicians can select from **3, 5, or 7-filter setups** using GVS SQ40 microaggregate filters to exponentially reduce pathogen loads.

-   **Operational Robustness**: VirusTC has developed specialized strategies to prevent UV-C-induced color changes in blood from interfering with apheresis optical sensors, ensuring seamless procedural reliability.

### **Commitment to Protected Lands and Communities**

VirusTC's clinical advancements in bloodwork support the stewardship of **Piru Creek, California**, and its surrounding federal lands. This project acknowledges the critical importance of these protected areas:

+3

-   **Protected Land Stewardship**: Piru Creek is a designated **Wild and Scenic River**, with 7.25 miles of its corridor protected under federal law to preserve its unique geological and biological values.

    +2

-   **Tribal Community Engagement**: This project respects and incorporates the interests of tribal communities, including the **Fernandeño-Tataviam Band of Mission Indians** and other tribes protected under federal agreements and the **Central Coast Heritage Protection Act**.

    +2

-   **Unified Access**: Through partnerships with **UW Medicine** and **Fred Hutch**, these life-saving technologies are part of a broader commitment to providing equitable, high-standard medical care while ensuring the ecological and cultural integrity of California's protected regions.
